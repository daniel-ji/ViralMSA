todo:
- preloading indexes 
- getting other aligners working
- web worker the pyodide 
- validation
- download button
- add runtime
- questions: what kind of files to accept? 

no async solution: 
    subprocess overridden -> runs javascript that runs pyodide webworker (that is async, but runPython covers that) so it's still technically sync (doesn't work)
    - either async or split python running

prevent await problem: 
    - override subprocess so that it runs python (async) -> which runs javascript (async), but the process only completes when the python async finishes

bug: args.reference is not defined
overriding: subprocess.call, check_output, Entrez.efetch

todo: 
start working on getting minimap2 
two wasm module plan
potential problems with multiprocessing, subprocess
    likely just one thread, one cpu
